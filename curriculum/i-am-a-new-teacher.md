# I'm a (new) teacher!

### Super nice that you joined our HYF teaching team, here are some practical things to help you get started:

\*:information_desk_person: If you don't have access to one of the things mentioned below, ask Maartje.

**Slack**
- Our Slack has channels for every class, the main goal here is that we support students with questions/their homework during the week. You of course don't have to join all of them, but please join the channel of the class that you are currently teaching or helping out with. If you are not in Slack yet: :information_desk_person: 
- We also have a mentor room (super secret). :information_desk_person: 

**Modules**
- All modules have their own repository in our Github organization.
- We also have a nice and shiny overview of our [curriculum](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/curriculum). Here you can find information about when/how and what we teach.
- We divided everyone in our organization into teams, we have a teachers team, a team for every class etc. which all have different permissions.
- We have a private repository where fellow teachers share their [BestTeachingPractices](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/BestTeachingPractices), if you are new to teaching or are just curious on what they think works well in class, take a look.
- If you are teaching a certain module and would like to make changes on the contents of the repo, please create a branch with your name and your fellow teacher, like: `yourname_othername`. Our master branches are protected, if you would like to change something to the default module please make a PR.

**Homework**
- *Trello* is used in the first three modules to hand in homework (first zip files) later links to Github repositories. :information_desk_person:
- Later on we use [this](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/Git/blob/master/Lecture-3.md) method to hand in homework.
